CookieCuttr
===========

A tailorable jQuery plugin to deal with the EU Cookie Law.

Useage
------

Add `jquery.cookiecuttr.js`, after jQuery and jQuery.cookie, and `cookiecuttr.css` to the head of your HTML document. Then call CookieCuttr on document ready.

```javascript
$(document).ready(function () {
  $.cookieCuttr();
});
```

For any JavaScript you want to disable, you need to wrap the following if statement around it.

```javascript
if (jQuery.cookie('cc_cookie_accept') == "cc_cookie_accept") {
  // insert the code you do not want to run UNTIL cookies are accepted here
}
```

Example with Google Analytics
-----------------------------

```javascript
if (jQuery.cookie('cc_cookie_accept') == "cc_cookie_accept") {
  var _gaq = _gaq || [];
  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X']);
  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);

  (function() {
    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;
    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://ssl' : 'http://www') + '.google-analytics.com/ga.js';
    var s = document. getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s);
  })();
}
```

Alternatively, you can do the following until cookies are declined.

```javascript
if (jQuery.cookie('cc_cookie_decline') == "cc_cookie_decline") {
  // do nothing
} else {
  var _gaq = _gaq || [];
  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X']);
  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);

  (function() {
    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;
    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://ssl' : 'http://www') + '.google-analytics.com/ga.js';
    var s = document. getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(ga, s);
  })();
}
```

You can also do the following.

```javascript
if( $.cookieAccepted() ) {
  // insert the code you do not want to run UNTIL cookies are accepted here
}
```

Options

For more options, see the WIKI.

```
cookieCutter - if you'd like to actively hide parts of your website set this to true, for example say you use a comments system that inserts cookies, you can put the div name in below to replace it with a cookie warning message.

cookieAnalytics - if you are just using a simple analytics package you can set this to true, it displays a simple default message with no privacy policy link - this is set to true by default.

cookieDeclineButton - if you'd like a decline button to (ironically) write a cookie into the browser then set this to true.

cookieAcceptButton - set this to true to hide the accept button, its set to false by default

cookieResetButton - if you'd like a reset button to delete the accept or decline cookies then set this to true.

cookieOverlayEnabled - don't want a discreet toolbar? this makes the whole message into a 100% height

cookiePolicyLink - if applicable, enter the link to your privacy policy in here - this is as soon as cookieAnalytics is set to false;
